A roadmap for android developers that can guide you from programming language and oop then very basics of the track Sequentially to build your advanced android application.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Before we start our roodmap , we have to talk about:

# ⁉️ What is Android ?
### Android is mobile device operating system  based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones 📱 and tablets 📱, TVs 📺, smartwatches ⌚ and cars 🚗.

### Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance, though its most widely used version is primarily developed by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device, the HTC Dream, being launched in September 2008.

# 📘 Why should you learn Android development?

### With a global presence on over 3 billion Android devices, Android has been the best-selling mobile operating system worldwide in the last decade. However, it is not just a smartphone OS anymore. It powers many other things, like Android Wear, e-Readers, Google Glass, and Android TV. For all of these devices, the development fundamentals are pretty much the same as they all are powered by Android. .</p>

<div align="center"> <h1>  🔹 we will start with Programming language and OOP level</h1> </div>

<h2>so why kotlin ...</h2>
At Google I/O 2019, we announced that Android development will be increasingly Kotlin-first, and we’ve stood by that commitment. Kotlin is an expressive and concise programming language that reduces common code errors and easily integrates into existing apps. If you’re looking to build an Android app, we recommend starting with Kotlin to take advantage of its best-in-class features .. <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/first" rel="nofollow">Learn More</a>
